Everything is a single frame animation unless noted.

Idle animation:
TreasureIdle00 to 11 (repeat)


Key Interaction:
1. When the player approaches with a key, we need the key to fly over to the treasure keyhole.

2. The key can disappear when it reaches the Treasure, after playing TreasureIdle11.

3. When the key disappears play
    -TreasureKeyA00 thru 11 (2 times)
    This is the Key rotating in the air in front of keyhole:
4. Then play TreasureKeyB00 thru 09 (1 time)
    TreasureKeyB07 should be 5 frames
    

Treasure Opening:
TreasureOpen00 thru 07 (1 time)


Heart Raising:
TreasureOpenIdle00 thru 01 (repeat)

Also you can use the "TreasureFace" decal to cover up the heart as it raises out.


Heart Collect:
After the Heart is collected, you can stop repeating "TreasureOpenIdle" animation.
And simply show the decal "TreasureCollected"
