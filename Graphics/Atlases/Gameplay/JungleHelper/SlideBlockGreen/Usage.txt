I'll try to keep this simple, but this is what the intent for these sprites is.

"small" is for the small blocks.
"big" is for the big blocks.
The rest of the labels are identical for the big and small blocks.

"left, right, up, down" are directional obviously. Most of each label has four variations for each direction.

"active" is for the block when a block crystal bas been collected, and the block can be moved with a dash. 

"inactive" if for when the block has been moved and a block crystal has not been collected, and the block can't be moved.
If the block is "inactive" and a block crystal has been collected, it will be changed to "active".

"hit" is for when the block has been moved. It will remain on the "hit" frame until it comes to a stop.

"stop" is the animation for when the block comes to a stop. If a block crystal has not been collected between the block being moved and the block stopping, the full "stop" animation will play.

Finally, "active_overlay" is an overlay of the center, that will be placed over the normal center of the block. 
If, while the block is moving, a block crystal is collected, this overlay will be used. The normal "stop" animation will play fully, but the center will be covered to make it look like it never deactivates like in the normal stop animation.
The overlay should probably be removed quickly after the "stop" animation finishes, and be replaced by a "active" sprite.

Sorry if a lot of this was obvious, I just didn't want there to be any confusion.
