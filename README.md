# Jungle Helper

This repository contains the helper and assets for the _Celeste: Into the Jungle_ mod. Both custom entities / triggers anf assets can be used in other maps (with credit) by having this helper as a dependency.

Contains the following entities so far:
- **Bouncy Shroom**: a mushroom Madeline can bounce on! Comes in up, up-left and up-right variants.
- **Climbable One-Way Platform**: a platform that looks like a sideways jumpthru, except you can go through it. Useful to make f.e. ropes you can climb on.
- **Theo Statue and Theo Statue Gate**: like a Theo crystal, but twice as tall and ungrabbable. It also does not prevent you from going to the next screen. The Theo statue gate opens when the Theo statue is nearby.
- **Zip Moving Platform**: a Resort-like moving platform that behaves like a zip mover.
- **Spiny Plant**: a vertical plant that kills you.
