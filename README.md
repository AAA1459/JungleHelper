# Jungle Helper

This repository contains the helper and assets for the _Celeste: Into the Jungle_ mod. Both custom entities / triggers and assets can be used in other maps (with credit) by having this helper as a dependency.

Contains the following entities so far:
- **Bouncy Shroom**: a mushroom Madeline can bounce on! Comes in up, up-left and up-right variants.
- **Climbable One-Way Platform**: a platform that looks like a sideways jumpthru, except you can go through it. Useful to make f.e. ropes you can climb on.
- **Theo Statue and Theo Statue Gate**: like a Theo crystal, but twice as tall and ungrabbable. It also does not prevent you from going to the next screen. The Theo statue gate opens when the Theo statue is nearby.
- **Zip Moving Platform**: a Resort-like moving platform that behaves like a zip mover.
- **Spiny Plant**: a vertical plant that kills you.
- **Slide Block**: a Kevin block that moves in the direction of your dash. Can either stop after moving by its own width/height, or continue until it hits a wall.
- **Invisible Jumpthru**: a jumpthru that is invisible in-game, but visible in Ahorn.
- **Spider Boss**: a spider that falls down from the ceiling and kills the player if it hits them. Comes in blue, purple and red variants, with varying speeds.

_This list is highly outdated._
